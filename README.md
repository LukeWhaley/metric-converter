This is my submission for OOP Assignment 3

To use this program, enter any number (1) followed by a space, and then type your conversion rate with an equals sign between the two metrics without spaces (km=m). 

Example: 10 oz=g

This program supports the following conversions, kilometers to meters (km=m), ounces to grams (oz=g), inches to feet (in=ft), and seconds to minutes (sec=min). You can also complete these conversions in either direction (km=m) <-> (m=km).
